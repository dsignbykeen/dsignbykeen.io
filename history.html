                 The first known "NFT", Quantum,was created by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash in <time>May 2014</time>. It consists of a video clip made by McCoy's wife, Jennifer. McCoy registered the video on the Namecoin blockchain and sold it to Dash for $4, during a live presentation for the Seven on Seven conference at the New Museum in New York City. McCoy and Dash referred to the technology as "monetized graphics".This explicitly linked a non-fungible, tradable blockchain marker to a work of art, via on-chain metadata (enabled by Namecoin). This is in contrast to the multi-unit, fungible, metadata-less "colored coins" of other blockchains and Counterparty.

                    <time>In October 2015</time>, the first NFT project, Etheria, was launched and demonstrated at <em><b>DEVCON 1</b></em> in London, Ethereum's first developer conference, three months after the launch of the Ethereum blockchain. Most of Etheria's 457 purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles went unsold for more than five years until March 13, 2021, when renewed interest in NFTs sparked a buying frenzy. Within 24 hours, all tiles of the current version and a prior version, each hardcoded to 1 ETH (US$0.43 at the time of launch), were sold for a total of US$1.4 million.

                    The term "NFT" only achieved wider usage with the ERC-721 standard, first proposed in 2017 via the Ethereum GitHub, following the launch of various NFT projects that year.The standard coincided with the launch of several NFT projects, including Curio Cards, CryptoPunks (a project to trade unique cartoon characters, released by the American studio Larva Labs on the Ethereum blockchain),and rare Pepe trading cards.

                <h3>Increased public awareness (2017–present)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 2017 online game CryptoKitties was made profitable by selling tradable cat NFTs, and its success brought public attention to NFTs.</li>
                    <li>The NFT market experienced rapid growth during 2020, with its value tripling to US$250 million.In the first three months of 2021, more than US$200 million were spent on NFTs.</li>
                    <li>In 2020, the U.S Patent and Trademark Office received three trademark applications for NFTs.In 2021, the number of trademark applications jumped to more than 1200.In January 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received 450 NFT-related trademark applications.The growing list of brands being trademarked for NFTs includes the NYSE, Star Trek, Panera, Walmart, Elvis Presley, Sports Illustrated, Ticketmaster, and Yahoo.</li>
                    <li>In the early months of 2021, interest in NFTs increased after a number of high-profile sales and art auctions.</li>
                    <li>In May 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported, "The NFT market is collapsing." Daily sales of NFT tokens declined 92% from September 2021, and the number of active wallets in the NFT market fell 88% from November 2021. While rising interest rates had impacted risky bets across the financial markets, the Journal said "NFTs are among the most speculative."</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>
                NFT have been in existence since 2014 and gaining rapid popularity in recent times as a platform to trade digital assets. According to Forbes,"the market for NFT was worth a staggering $41billion in 2021 alone, an amount that is approaching the total value of the entire global fine art market."
